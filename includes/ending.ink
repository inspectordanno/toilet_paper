=== water_ending ===
After using all the clothing you’re willing to part with, your ass is so clean you wouldn’t mind if your crush took their tongue to it later tonight. Now to flush away the evidence and get back to the party. The water rushes in, swirls, your shitty rags disappear…almost. The toilet chokes and gurgles. Water fills the bowl and keeps rising. “The fuck!” your stall neighbor says. Their door slams open and they’re out. You hike your pants and try to do the same.
The water won’t stop. You’re standing in a good inch of it already but before you make it to the door, the janitor bursts in and digs into the clog with his bare hands, up to his elbows in shit water. Maybe you can still sprint out of here, but what’s this? The door’s held open by partygoers, your old classmates, all here to watch the show. They’re all laughing, no doubt in their minds who the culprit is here. Finally the water calms, the janitor raises your shit rag high and triumphant above his head. “Well there’s your problem,” he says. Your crush pushes through the crowd. “PLAYER NAME  what in the fuck? Oh god…” they vomit, a red stream of the spiked punch you were feeding them earlier. “Good thing the janitor is here,” you say.
THE END.
-> END

You got shit on your hands. When you go back to your crush at the party and they ask if you didn’t wipe your ass. 
GAME OVER.
