{beginning == 1: It’s finally over. The diarrhea’s out of you and in the toilet and your legs are numb but your tummy isn’t gurgling anymore. You sigh, wipe your sweaty forehead, and reach for the TP but find only a cold metal rod that should be holding a cardboard tube and layers of soft paper that would feel so good on your chapped, burning anus.}
{beginning == 1: You want nothing more than to get back to your ten year high school reunion where your old crush was chatting you up at the punch bowl. You told them you’d just be a minute and it’s already been five but you had to make sure the brown soup was all out of you. The last thing you need would be an unplanned release later tonight.}
